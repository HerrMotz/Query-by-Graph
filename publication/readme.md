### Template
The template (ilm.typ) is originally a work by [Muhammad Talal Anwar](https://github.com/talal). His work was licensed under MIT-0 (no mention), but I chose to mention him anyway.
This adaptation, which mainly adds a title page in german and english and structures the bibliography and appendix according to the guidelines of the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Sciences.

### The work itself
The thesis (main.typ) is my own work and I, for now, reserve all rights to it and all other files in the repository, e.g. the graphics/images.

## Writing Guidelines

+ Be friendly and open-minded. Every statement is an invitation to sceptically ponder over the stated. Reflect it in the used formulation. E.g.: "Such statements are usually called qualifiers. \[8\]" as opposed to "Such statements are called qualifiers."

+ Try to avoid abbreviations in headings. Exempt are acronyms which are more well known than their definition, e.g. OWL, and recursive acronyms: In this case find a sleak alternative, e.g. "SPARQL Query Language".

+ Do not use the acronym/abbreviation and its definition in the heading, e.g. "Visual Query Graph (VQG)".

+ Use `raw text` in running text for anything the reader should think of as a value in a computer, e.g. `8/7/2000`. If the representation layer is not interesting, this indication is superfluous.

+ Use the following hyphentation/seperation:
    - SPARQL-OWL Mapping
    - Visual Query Graph-SPARQL Mapping
    - SPARQL Select-Query // TODO: What's the concept behind hyphenation?

+ Labels for headings follow the scheme: `heading:<name_of_the_heading>`

+ Labels for examples follow the scheme: `ex:<name>`

+ Labels for definitions follow the scheme: `def_<name>`
