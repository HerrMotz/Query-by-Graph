# Query by Graph (QuebyG)

## Motivation
https://blog.factgrid.de/archives/2596

## Abstract
As part of HisQu and πάρεδρος, I propose a collection of tools, which allow unintroduced users to interact with ontologies using a visual SPARQL query builder. Furthermore, QuebyG analyses arbitrary RDF-triple databases and generates suggestion based on a natural language prompt.
